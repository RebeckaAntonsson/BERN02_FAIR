# BERN02_FAIR
First exercise in BERN02, called workflows and FAIR principles 

Description: The script malaria.py will take two input files (malaria.fna and malaria.blastx), 
and create an output file. The output file will consist mainly of the FASTA file
but with the protein description (found in the blastx file) added to the header.

The output file needs to be named output.txt and will be saved in your current 
working directory.

User-defined functions: None
Non-standrad modules: None

Procedure:
    
Input: malaria.fna and malaria.blastx
Output: output.txt
